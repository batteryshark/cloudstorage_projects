General Structure:

    JKLConfig - config object to load configurations for different providers (tokens etc).
    JKLGlobals - holds global session data such as available provider objects.
    JKLAPI - framework for provider-based operations.

    plugins - plugin package for different provider types.
    JKLogging - Universal Logging Engine


so basically, you init the api, you set up providers through it, those do everything they need to get a token and all that
then, you perform high-level operations based on the storage object globally available

responses are passed to a response handler in the api... so a status thats given as 401 (unauthorized) would be passed to
the handler for that operation.
TODO: Get all responses from the api documentation and handle them.
